# neurons-analysis

Three datasets have been used for this project:
– neurons group 1.csv: contains information about the morphology of a group of brain cell, known as neurons.
– neurons group 2.csv: contains information about the morphology of a second group of neurons.
– neurons additional measurements.csv: contains additional morphology measurements for the neurons included in 1st and 2nd dataset.

Part 1: exploratory data analysis including numercial and graphical summary has been performed on neurons group1.csv file. 

Part 2: data analysis including t-test for each measurements has been performed.

Part 3: all 3 datasets are combined and correlation is checked for each measurements of neurons.

Part 4: Linear regression is performed to predict the total surface area of a neuron. AIC and BIC is used to select the model.

Part 5: Random forest regression is used to predict the total surface area of a neuron.

Par 6: Clustering algorithms are used to identify different neuron types.
